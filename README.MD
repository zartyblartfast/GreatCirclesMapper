# Great Circle Mapper

The Great Circle Mapper is a web application designed to help users visualize the shortest distance between two airports on the Earth's surface, also known as a great circle. This tool is useful for pilots, travelers, and anyone interested in geography and aviation.

## Features

- Search for airports by country and airport code.
- Add pairs of airports to visualize the great circle path between them.
- View suggested pairs of airports.
- Data is persisted in the browser's local storage, so your added pairs will still be there when you come back!

## Usage

To use the Great Circle Mapper, simply select two airports from the dropdown menus and click the "Add" button. The great circle path between the two airports will be displayed on the map. You can also click the "Suggestions" button to see some interesting pre-selected pairs of airports.
